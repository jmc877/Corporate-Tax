    <h3>Required Texts and Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> In prior years, we used Yin & Burke, Corporate Taxation (2nd ed. 2016).  I think the book is very solid, but many students did not.  Consequently, I'm not going to require it this year, but you won't be harmed by buying a used version for $20 and reading it. </li>  
      
      <li> I'm going to emphasize learning corporate tax through problems that we cover together in class.  For an overview of the topics, you should read either Yin & Burke (YB), the Taxation of Corporations and Stockholders in a Nutshell (2019) (N)--the author is the co-author of YB--or the Black Letter Outline (2019) (B) on Corporate Taxation.  As you know, the latter two are available for free (my favorite price) here: <a href="https://lawpac.lawnet.fordham.edu/record=b788050">WL Study Guides</a>.  I'll list the appropriate readings for each topic from each book.</li>
      
      <li>You'll need access to the Code & Regs.  I like CCH, Selected Sections (2021-2022), but you can use the Code & Regs published by West or Foundation.  I recommend that you keep it next to you to mark up during class and while doing the problems and readings. Feel free to use the version from your basic Income Tax class or one that was published last year--don't worry, it will be fine. Here a pdf of the <a href="IRC_19_20.pdf">IRC ('19-'20)</a> </li>
      
      <li>The Code and Regs are available on line at <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research">Tax Materials</a>.  This is a fantastic free database of fundamental tax materials.  On the Additional Resources tab, I show how to make a bookmark that will take you directly to the appropriate code or regulation section.  All relevant tax materials are also available on BLaw, WL, Lexis, or Vital Law (formally Cheetah).</li>
      
      <li>For each topic, take a glance at the problems and then read either YB, N, or B,  and then any additional readings.  Use the slides to focus on the important materials that we'll cover during the lectures.</li>
      
    </ul>
